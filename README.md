# Linux-Commands

## pwd
The `pwd` command stands for "print working directory" in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It prints the absolute path of the current working directory to the standard output.

Explanation:
- The current working directory is the directory in which a user is currently working. It's important to know the current working directory to navigate the file system effectively.
- Running pwd provides the full path to the current directory, starting from the root directory (/) of the file system.
- This command is particularly useful when you need to know the exact location in the file system where you are working. It helps in understanding the directory structure and facilitates navigation and file manipulation tasks.

```bash
pwd
```

## ls
The ls command is used in Linux and Unix-based operating systems to list files and directories in the current working directory. It's a fundamental command for navigating the file system and understanding what files and directories are present.
Options
- `-l`: Displays the long format listing, which includes detailed information about each file or directory.
- `-h`: Makes file sizes human-readable, so you can easily understand the sizes of files.
- `-a`: Shows all files, including hidden files starting with '.'.

```bash
ls
```
